 * HARD JUST TRY YOUR BEST
 * Do the same as the previous question, ask the user how many seats they need (no more than 4). Loop through the array and find the available seats they can book.
 * If they are booking more than 1 seat, they want to sit in the same row, check the subsequent seats to see if they are booked and print out the available seats.
